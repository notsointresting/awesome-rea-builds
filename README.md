</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scope and trust:** 44 public cases, **not 44 independently verified working apps**. We catalog 14 app reconstructions, 6 interoperability projects, 6 integrations, 5 official focused studies, 10 analysis cases and 3 learning resources. Official showcases, GitHub Discussions and studies are labeled as such. We have not independently built or executed third-party code.

## What makes this different?

Other valuable REA directories cover a huge range of links. Here each case receives a **Build Passport** (implementation) or **Case Passport** (analysis/showcase), with exactly what REA contributed, direct upstream evidence, what exists, execution status and limitations. The interactive website supports search, multi-filter discovery, deep links and side-by-side comparison.

The public sources for 42 of the 44 catalogued cases were retrievable through our GitHub research connection on **November 11, 2026**. Two community GitHub Discussion links could not be retrieved through the available interfaces and are explicitly marked **discussion listed**, not verified. A retrievable source does *not* mean we confirmed that its application works.

## Website

This project is ready for **GitHub Pages**. For this public repository, set **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. The included workflow will build and publish the self-contained static site on push to `main`.

- Run locally: `python3 scripts/build.py && python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist`
- Visit: `http://localhost:8080`
- No Node install, server, API keys, backend or external deployment service is required. The site works offline, with system-font fallbacks.
- The expected future GitHub Pages address will be `https://notsointresting.github.io/awesome-rea-builds/` **after it is actually published**.

## Build Passports

Each record includes its target, implementation or study, primary evidence link, technology when known, platform when confirmed, source-reported outputs, limitations, review date and independent-execution state. **Unknown** remains unknown; we never fill gaps with guessed compatibility, build commands or benchmark claims.
